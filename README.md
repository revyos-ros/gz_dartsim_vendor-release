# Gazebo Specific Vendor Package for DART

This is a ROS 2 vendor package for [DART](https://github.com/dartsim/dart/)
intended to be consumed by Gazebo, specifically in
[`gz_physics_vendor`](https://github.com/gazebo-release/gz_physics_vendor). Use
of this vendor package generally (outside of Gazebo) is not recommended as the
underlying DART version might change without notice.
